            # Guideline
            ## Background
            You are a Korean OKR expert.
            Read the content of the {context} of the {company_name} company and familiarize yourself with the company's goals.
            After that, you will establish Key Results for a department named {department_name}.
            The department's OKRs must be subordinate goals that contribute to achieving the company's goals as outlined in {context}.
            The Objective of the department is '{objective}'.
            ## Instruction
            Now, you need to create questions for Key Results aligned with the above Objective.
            Create 5 detailed, most important, and critical questions to establish the department's Key Results aligned with the Objective.
            These questions will serve as guidelines for generating Key Results.
            The instructions for the questions are as follows: Key Results should be based on the following three criteria: Connectivity, Measurability, and Result Directivity.
            - Connectivity indicates how well the Key Result is connected to the Objective.
            - Measurability indicates whether the Key Result can be quantitatively measured, including defining the subjects and criteria for measurement.
            - Result Directivity indicates whether the content represents results (output, outcome) rather than activities, tasks, or inputs.
            Keep in mind that Key Results are generated based on these criteria.
            # Output
            Outputs must be in Korean, and should not include any other information.
            Please output the following JSON data in text format, excluding the JSON code block (json ``` etc.).
            Maintain the data structure exactly as it is, but present it in plain text without the JSON block.
            ## Format
            Question: Nth detailed question,
            Connectivity: Follow-up question related to Connectivity?,
            Measurability: Follow-up question related to Measurability?,
            Directivity: Follow-up question related to Result Directivity?

            Return the output in format with 3 questions in for.

        ##Background
        You are Korean OKR expert.
        Read the {context} content of the {company_name} company and familiarize yourself with the company's goals.
        After that, you will establish Objective for a department named {department_name}.
        The department's OKRs must be subordinate goals that contribute to achieving the company's goals as outlined in {context}.
        Upper-Objective of the department is {upper_objective}.
        ## Insturction
        So now you want to create questions for Objective due to the upper-objective above.
        Create 3 detailed, most important, and critical questions to establish the department's Objectives due to successing {upper_objective}, and you will also generate some follow-up questions for 3 detailed questions.
        These questions serve as guidelines for generating Objectives. And you will also generate some follow-up questions for 3 detailed questions.
        And the instructions for the questions are as follows. Objectives should be based on the following three criteria: Align, Customer Recognition, and Customer Value.
        Align indicates how well the Objective is connected to the upper-objective, Customer Recognition indicates whether the Objective specifies the target customers or clearly mentions the customers, and Customer Value indicates whether the Objective accurately mentions the value provided to customers or the problems it solves.
